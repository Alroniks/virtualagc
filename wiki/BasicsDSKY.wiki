#summary Basic Introduction of the DSKY

= 1. DSKY Basics =
The DSKY is the "display/keyboard" used by the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC).  The DSKY provided only a means to input keyboard data to the AGC, or to display visual information at command of the AGC, and therefore had little or no functionality of its own, when considered as a stand-alone device. The DSKY was used in both the Command Module and the Lunar Module.

== 1.1 Interacting with DSKY ==
The DSKY design used a pretty simple but smart interface to allow the user to interact with the AGC. A method of verbs and nouns were used to request an operation (i.e. the verb) and on what (i.e. noun) you wanted this operation to execute on. Each distinct verb was assigned a number and each noun was assigned a number. For example the verb "display" was assigned the number 16 and noun 36 was assigned to "ground elapsed time (GET)". So to display the current GET you would press "V" followed by the number 16 and then "N" followed by the numbers 36 thereafter executed when pressing Entr key. A shorthand notation in check lists was used to express the above sequence: V16N36E. In somecases just a simple verb was sufficient to execute a certain command.

Similarly if the AGC required the user to input certain values it would display a flashing Verb noun combination to indicate that user input is requested.

To display output in response to a request or when punching input in the DSKY the registers R1 (top row), R2 (middle row) and R3 (bottom row) were used.

To show which program was running the right top 2 digits were used. Programs were applications that executed a specific task. For example program 64 (P64) was the high gate approach program where as P66 was the final landing phase program and P68 the post landing shutdown program to prevent inadvertent RCS firing. A program was typically started with the verb 37 followed by a noun equal to the program number. So to start program 66 one would enter: V37N66E

When entering numbers it was assumed that octal numbers where used unless the user would use the sign +/- symbol; in that case decimal numbers were assumed. Also when using decimal numbers leading zeros must be entered this is not the case for octal numbers. When input is requested in R1 the row for R1 would clear and the user can provide its input. To correct the input press the CLR key before pressing Entr.

== 1.2 Some Basic Commands ==
The following is a list of some basic commands to demonstrate the interaction with the DSKY.

|| *Verb Noun* || *Description*                                                     ||
|| V35E        || Execute Lamp Test                                                 ||
|| V36E        || Fresh restart                                                     ||
|| V16N36E     || Display ground Elapsed Time (GET)                                 ||
|| V25N36E     || Set GET. R1 for hours, R2 for minutes and R3 for 1/100 of seconds ||
|| V01N02E     || Single shot peek at erasable memory address R3 in octal           ||
|| V21N02E     || Poke value R2 into erasable memory address R3 in octal)                                                   ||
|| V11N02E     || Continuous peek at erasable memory address (R3 in octal)          ||
