= 1. Orbital Mechanics Introduction =
The intention of this section is to introduce you to some very basic concepts of orbital mechanics. At the end of this section you should be able to calculate some orbital parameters, understand how to change orbits (i.e. change in velocity to obtain a new orbit) and how to calculate burn times to achieve the new orbit. This will be useful when using the LGC simulation to change orbits. 

== 1.1 What is an Orbit ==
An orbit is the movement of a (small body) object around a usually much larger body (e.g. planet or moon) in space in the shape of an elliptical. The elliptical shape is determined by the velocity of the small body and its distance to the center of gravity of the larger body. The location of the closest and farthest point of an orbiting object around a body is fixed irrespective of the larger bodies rotation. This brings up the difference between a revolution and an orbit. A revolution is defined relative to a position on the body that you are orbiting. For example since the Earth turns around its axis a revolution around the Earth will be more then an orbit if you orbit in the direction of the rotation. So the time to complete an orbit may not be the same as the revolution time. An object in orbit is continuously falling towards the body that it is orbiting but because of its velocity never reaches the surface. When an object moves in an eliptical orbit there will be a point where it is closest (periapsis) to the body it orbits and a point where it is farthest (apoapsis). When in apoapsis the object has its slowest speed in the orbit and will start falling back to the body and exchange potential energy for kinetic energy. If the object travels to slow at a certain distance then its path will intersect with the object it was orbiting or if it travels to fast at a certain distance then it will never return (a.k.a escape velocity). Depending on the body that is being orbited the names of the closest and farthest approach change their suffix (e.g. apogee and perigee when orbiting the Earth, aphelion and perihelion when orbiting the Sun and apolune and perilune when orbitting the Moon).

== 1.2 Orbital Math ==
To determine orbit parameters of an object (e.g. spacecraft) one needs to understand some basic math and definitions of an eliptical orbit. Since this project provides an LM simulator lets assume for reference that our spacecraft is orbiting the Moon. The distance between the perilune and apolune is called the major axis and half of this distance is known as the semi-major axis. If we define the semi-major axis to be equal to _a_ then the major axis equals _2a_. Each point of the orbit has a distance _r_ to the center of the attracting body (e.g. Moon). The distance where the spacecraft is closest to the center of the attracting body will be referred to as _r,,p,,_ (i.e. in perilune) and the furthest distance (i.e. in apolune) _r,,a,,_ and so:

   _r,,a,,_ + _r,,p,, = _2a_.

The measure of how elliptical an orbit is is expressed with eccentricity _e_. If _e = 0_ we have a perfect circular orbit. For _e < 1_ we have an eliptical orbit and when _e = 1_ we have reached escape velocity and _e > 1_ means we are no longer in orbit; the spacecraft will never return. The eccentricity has the following relation with _r,,a,,_ and _r,,p,,_

   _r,,a,,_ = _a_(1 - _e_ )
   
   _r,,p,,_ = _a_(1 + _e_ )

Now we have enough to calculate the velocity _v_ at perilune and apolune if we desire an orbit that has a a closest approach of 100km above the surface of the Moon and a fartest piont of 500km above the surface. Since the Moon has an average radius of 1738 km (i.e. 1738000 m) we can now determine _r,,a,,_ and _r,,p,,._ and _a_

  _r,,a,,_ = 2238000 m
  
  _r,,p,,_ = 1838000 m
  
  _a_ = (_r,,a,,_ + _r,,p,,_) / 2 = (2238000 m + 1838000 m) / 2 = 2038000 m

Now we can determine if this orbit is actually stable with regards to these parameters

   _e_ =   _r,,a,,_ / _a_ - 1 
   
   _e_ =  -_r,,p,,_ / _a_ + 1
   
   _e_ = 0.098135
   
Since the eccentricity is less than 1 the orbit is stable and achievable.

To calculate the velocity in at either apolune or perilune we need the gravitational parameter _u_ for the body we are orbiting (i.e. 4.9*10^12^ m^3^/s^2^ ) and the following formula:

   _v_ = *SQRT*( _u_ ( 2/_r,,x,,_ - 1 / _a_ ) ) 

   where _r,,x,,_ is is the distance to the center of the orbiting body.
   
So the velocity at perilune (i.e. 100km above the lunar surface) is:

   _v_ = *SQRT*(4.9*10^12^ m^3^/s^2^ (2/1838000 m - 1 / 2038000 m)) = 1711.013 m/s
