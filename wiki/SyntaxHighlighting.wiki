= 1 Syntax Highlighting AGC Assembly =
In order to enhance the readability of the AGC assembler code several syntax highlighting options are available for a select set of tools. These syntax highlighting definition files will attempt to highlight comments, assembler instructions and YUL directives differently from normal text to allow easy recognition of the AGC specifics as well as the YUL assembler directive. If you are familiar with the list of supported editors below then most likely you do not need additional guidance on how to install the highlight definition files (located in the yaSyntax directory) for your preferred tool. However if you need additional help you can access the "EnableSyntaxAGC" document (Open Office format).

== 1.1 Supported Editors ==
The following list of editors is currently supported:
  * Code::Blocks
  * Eclipse
  * Kate
  * Textpad
  * Vim
  * Programmer's Notepad
  * jEdit

== 1.2 Syntax Colours ==
The syntax related colours vary from editor to editor and are in many cases based on user or default preferences. However as a general guideline to aid you in reading and to teach AGC or AEA assembler one can distinguish the following code categories that in most cases will have a different colour for each of the supported editors.

  * Comments (e.g. # Some Comment )
  * AGC Instruction Set (e.g. CAF, BZF )
  * YUL Pseudo Codes (BANK, BLOCK, COUNT)
  * AGC Interpreted Instruction Codes (e.g. STORE, STCALL, COS)

Not only are the Interpreted instructions in a different colour they are also enclosed in a combination (assuming no jumps are made out of the code bloc) of TC INTERPRET and EXIT.

== 1.3 Beyond Editors ==
Besides the syntax highlighting in editors you can also see full browsable code listings on the VirtualAGC project site using the syntax colour scheme (e.g. [http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/listings/Luminary099/FRESH_START_AND_RESTART.agc.html FRESH_START_AND_RESTART.agc]) as well as in the SVN source browser of GoogleCode using the google-code-prettify engine (e.g. [http://code.google.com/p/virtualagc/source/browse/trunk/Luminary099/FRESH_START_AND_RESTART.agc FRESH_START_AND_RESTART.agc]).
