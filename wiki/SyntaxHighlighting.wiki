= 1 Syntax Highlighting AGC Assembly =
In order to enhance the readability of the AGC assembler code several syntax highlighting options are available for a select set of tools. These syntax highlighting definition files will attempt to highlight comments, assembler instructions and YUL directives differently from normal text to allow easy recognition of the AGC specifics as well as the YUL assembler directive. If you are familiar with the list of supported editors below then most likely you do not need additional guidance on how to install the highlight definition files (located in the yaSyntax directory) for your preferred tool. However if you need additional help you can access the "EnableSyntaxAGC" document (Open Office format).

== 1.1 Supported Editors ==
The following list of editors is currently supported:
  * Code::Blocks
  * Eclipse
  * Kate
  * TextPad
  * Vim
