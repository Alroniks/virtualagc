= 1. LM Simulator Tutorial =

This tutorial is intended to get you started with the AGC running in LGC (Lunar Guidance Computer) mode in conjunction with the virtual static simulator (developed by Stephan Hotto). Running the AGC in LGC mode  means that the AGC is configured to operate for conditions suitable for the Lunar Module. To do this you must run the yaAGC emulator with the option --cfg=<your_path>/LM.ini
The LM_Simulator itself is a so called "plant" model of the Apollo Lunar Module which simulates the hardware around the LGC.

== 1.1 Requirements ==

Since the LM Simulator is written in Tcl/Tk you must have both the tcl and tk packages installed for Linux and the free distribution of [http://www.activestate.com/Products/activetcl/index.mhtml ActiveTcl] package for Windows. The simulator has been tested with Tcl version 8.4.
 
== 1.2 Starting the Simulation ==

To start the simulation you must first launch the AGC emulator running the Luminary131 code from MIT. The emulator must be forced into the LGC mode as previously discussed to avoid getting the yaAGC debug terminal due to an opcode trap that avoids infinite loops. Use the proper configuration option to select the LM mode.

Once the LGC is running you can optionally start the yaACA (Attitude Control Assembly) to control the Lunar Module with your joystick. The ACA capability is currently only available on Linux. To start the simulator simply run:
{{{
wish lm_simulator.tcl lm_simulator.ini 
}}}
If the specified configuration file cannot be found the simulator will assume the LM-7 mission configuration.

== 1.3 Simulator Layout ==

The simulator has 5 main areas of concern each of which is represented with its own window:
   * The computer keyboard and display interface also known as the DSKY
   * The LGC outputs for monitoring and correlating the AGC binary actuators
   * The LGC inputs to simulate the binary AGC sensors
   * The crew inputs to simulate the buttons, RHC/ACA and THC connected to the LGC
   * The Flight Director Attitude Indicator (FDAI) showing the LM attitude in relation to the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
